# Wedding Management
Project built with Vue.js to manage wedding invitations. It communicates with the API built [in this project](https://github.com/jorgeribeiro/wedding-rsvp).

## Components
I used the [Vuetify Design Framework](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) to design the views in the project.

## Setting up
First you need to setup and run the [API](https://github.com/jorgeribeiro/wedding-rsvp). Then you run `cp .env.example .env` in the root directory of this project and after that you must set the API path correctly in the `VUE_APP_API_URL` variable within the `.env`. If the communication works, it is possible to list and add wedding invitations from this project.

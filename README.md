# Wedding Management
Project built with Vue.js to manage wedding invitations. It communicates with the API built [in this project](https://github.com/jorgeribeiro/wedding-rsvp).

## Components
I used the [Vuetify Design Framework](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) to design the views in the project.

## Why did you build this?
I am getting married and I challenged myself to build my own invitation system instead of spending money on an existing one. It is paying off so far.
